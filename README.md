# tiny-electron

Tiny-electron is a simple rich-text editor written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS([Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) web app \<EWA\> made with [TinyMCE 5](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce)). Currently in a developmental stage: [use cautiously if at all!](#Notes)

## Launch

## Screenshot

There is no truth without pictures.

## Requirements

Windows 7 64-bit, or above.

## Features

* Rich-text editor. rich-text, and HTML code(plain text) editing modes.
* Open and save files as restricted rich-text (HTML).
* Rich-text editing mode is restricted to the formatting options of HTML and a small amount more. The rich-text features that are supported include headings, bold, italics, strikethrough, bulleted lists, numbered lists, links, block quotes, underline, horizontal lines, tables, images, superscript, and subscript. Everything else( e.g. font size, colors, alignment, positioning, etc.) is automatically filtered as soon as it enters the editor.
* Extensive keyboard shortcuts. See [keyboard-shortcuts.md](docs/keyboard-shortcuts.md) for a list.

## Notes

The editor is still under development and has [many bugs](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) that need to be fixed.



Rich-text HTML editing with the editor is solid.

The editor has only been tested on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)(Google Chromium) at this time.


### Future

* Lots of [bug fixes](docs/bugs-and-to-do.md) and minor features.
* Tabs for multiple files at once?
* Tabs for folder/workspace and document table of contents?
* Other things...
